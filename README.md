`orca_sim` provides simulation environments for the ORCA hand.
You can start building your ORCA hand today at [orcahand.com](https://www.orcahand.com/).

## Install

We recommend using python 3.11 inside of a virtual environment.
You can create a virtual environment using `uv` ([how to install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)):

```bash
uv venv orca --python 3.11
source orca/bin/activate
uv pip install orca_sim
```

Alternatively, you can use `conda` ([how to install conda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install)):
```bash
conda create -n orca python=3.11 -y
conda activate orca
python -m pip install orca_sim
```
As we are continuously iterating on `orca_sim`, you can fetch the latest `main` building this package from source, so to be in the loop with the latest developments.

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

> [!WARNING] We are still iterating (a lot!) on this package. If you need stability, consider sticking to the Pypi package (`pip install orca_sim`).

## Getting started

`orca_sim` follows the [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) API, and uses [Mujoco](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html) for physics simulation and rendering.
You can instantiate an environment with one hand (or both) via:

```python
from orca_sim import OrcaHandRight  # or OrcaHandLeft, OrcaHandCombined

env = OrcaHandRight()
obs, info = env.reset()
obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(env.action_space.sample())
env.close()
```
